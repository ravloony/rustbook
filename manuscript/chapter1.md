# Introduction

## What is this book?

This book is an overview of the differences between Rust and older languages. It is aimed at experienced developers who already have knowledge and experience in languages that are procedural or object-oriented. So it will be assumed that you, the reader know all of the normal programming constructs from languages of those types, such as loops, classes, pointers, and so on. This book aims to complete that existing knowledge by introducing and explaining concepts that are unique to Rust in this context, such as ownership, lifetimes, traits, and to a lesser extent, structs.

## Why this book?

All of the above concepts are very well explained in detail in the official Rust book, and readers are encouraged to read that too. But I once created a service in Rust, having never used the language before, and at the time I would have liked to have at my disposal a book that was singularly focused on what I needed to know, and no more. That is the book I am trying to write. Of course, there will naturally be overlap with other documentation and indeed, the Rust book, but it is to be hoped that my perspective and experience carries enough value to make this book worthwhile.
